Frequently Asked Questions
Find answers for the most common questions
Which wallets are supported?

Our focus in development has been on the MetaMask wallet, but we are looking to expand this soon.

Which chains are supported?

Woah is available to any user in the crypto world that has an EVM-supported wallet address.
Currently the available NFT collections you can chose from for your avatar are limited to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain & KCC however.

Are there any fees associated with creating or owning a profile?

No!
Woah is providing all its services for free.
You may buy additional customisation options like profile badges and custom backgrounds from our store to make your profile more unique, get special benefits (depending on the NFT) and support our development of Woah.
The payment for those can be done in USDC, USDT, KCS or KuDoge tokens.

Can I sell the badges and backgrounds?

Yes!
All of our profile accessories like the badges and backgrounds are ERC-1155 NFTs that can be sold, traded or sent to other users. An internal market for Woah NFTs is planned, but for now you may use third party NFT marketplaces like KuSwap.

Can I search for profiles?

Yes!
Expand the top menu by tapping the arrow next to "My Profile" and then hit "Search".
You can search for profiles by username or by wallet address. Please mind that users can disable being found by their wallet address in the profile settings.

From which devices can I access my profile?

Your profile can be accessed from any device that has a modern web browser - be it a PC, smartphone, tablet or maybe even your smart fridge. To edit or create a profile you will have to be on a browser that has a wallet extension, or the native app of a wallet provider. If you don't yet have one of those, we recommend installing MetaMask.
